## Bryan's Make Change Project
This program will make change. Follow the prompts and do NOT add any characters other than numbers
as this program is NOT "idiot proof" and will break; This program will accept any double variable,
though the denomination returned will not exceed twenty; E.g. if the customer pays 2,678,987.7654
for a free item, the biggest returned denominator and number will be 133949 twenties- no hundred, hundred thousand, or bigger bill. Consequently, the smallest denominator returned will be a penny;

As a side note, the program will run a double variable with commas in it.

Moving on, the code can very likely be cleaned up and truncated by a more skilled programmer. The "math" part of the program took the better part of six hours and the sysout format to print the correct change of number and type took around five hours.
